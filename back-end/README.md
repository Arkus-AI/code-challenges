# Back-end Challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to get a better understanding of your back-end technical skills. We use Node.js (Typescript) to build our backend services at Arkus, and that's what we would like to make an assessment on. 

## Movie Metadata API

Build a RESTful API for a streaming platform to manage metadata for their movies.

## Preface

- Build the API using Node.js and TypeScript.
- Feel free to use any open source libraries that you find useful, as long as you can motivate your choices.
- For storing and managing data, you are free to use anything from a RDBMS to an in-memory database.
- There is one dataset that you should use for seeding your database: [movies.csv](./movies.csv).

## Requirements

- **List movies**: An endpoint for listing movies. The endpoint should support pagination.
- **Update movie**: An endpoint for updating a specific movie.

## Bonus points

If you have time left, you can implement one or more of the following nice-to-have features:

- Add filtering by genre or title to the list movies endpoint.
- Add sorting by title or release date to the list movies endpoint.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Correctness and completeness of the implemented features.
- Code organization and structure.
- Adherence to best practices for REST API development.
- Proper use of TypeScript features.
- Quality and coverage of unit and acceptance tests.
- Documentation completeness and clarity.

## Submission

- Submit the project as a GitHub repository.
- Include a README file with setup instructions, implementation notes and documentation for how to call your API.
- Invite `VladimirLi` and `mferno` as collaborators to the repository.

Best of luck, and we look forward to see your solution!
