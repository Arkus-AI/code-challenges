# **Senior Software Engineer Technical Assignment**

## **AI Agent Platform - System Architecture Design**

**Time Allocation:** 3-4 hours  
**Format:** Architecture diagrams + written documentation  
**Submission:** PDF or shared document with diagrams and explanations

---

## **Assignment Overview**

Design the complete system architecture for an AI agent platform that enables users to create, deploy, and manage AI agents for workflow automation.

## **Platform Requirements**

### **Core Functionality**
- **Agent Builders** can create, configure, test, deploy, and manage AI agents
- **End Users** can discover, select, and interact with deployed agents  
- **Agents** integrate with external APIs, databases, and third-party services
- **Agents** maintain context and memory across interactions
- **Platform** supports both real-time and scheduled agent execution

### **User Access & Security**
- Strict access controls separating agent management from agent usage
- Fine-grained permissions for different platform features
- Secure authentication and authorization for all actions
- Comprehensive logging and traceability of platform activity

### **Integration & Extensibility**
- Agents must connect to external systems (email, databases, Slack, custom APIs)
- Support for adding new integration types
- Agent-to-agent communication and task handoff capabilities

## **Business Context**

- **Scale:** Platform should handle growth from hundreds to tens of thousands of users
- **Team:** Small engineering team responsible for building and operating the platform
- **Execution:** Agent execution times vary significantly based on complexity and external dependencies
- **Compliance:** Platform must support audit requirements and data governance policies

## **Deliverables**

### **System Architecture**
- High-level architecture diagram showing major components
- Data flows and communication patterns
- Technology stack recommendations
- Security and access control design

### **Design Rationale**
- Key architectural decisions and trade-offs
- Approach to scalability and performance
- Strategy for reliability and fault tolerance
- Operational considerations and monitoring approach

### **Implementation Planning**
- Major technical challenges and mitigation strategies
- Deployment and infrastructure considerations
- Development and maintenance requirements

## **Evaluation Focus**

We're looking for:
- Clear architectural thinking and system design skills
- Understanding of real-world constraints and trade-offs
- Practical approach to building scalable, maintainable systems
- Consideration of security, compliance, and operational requirements

## **Submission Guidelines**

- **Format:** PDF document or shared online document
- **Required:** Architecture diagrams (tools of your choice)
- **Length:** Focus on clarity and completeness over volume
- **Technology:** Use technologies you're comfortable with and can justify
- **Assumptions:** Document any assumptions about requirements or constraints
