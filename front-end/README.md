# Front-end Challenges

The purpose of this challenge is to assess your front-end skills. We use React with TypeScript for our front-end projects, so we would like you to use these technologies for the challenge. Please utilize `create-react-app` with TypeScript. You are welcome to use any other open-source libraries that you find helpful, as long as you can justify your choices. There are no restrictions on styling, so you can use any CSS framework or library of your choice. We use [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/) for our projects, so you can opt to use it if you prefer.

You have the option to choose between two challenges. You only need to complete one of them. The first challenge is a blog app, and the second challenge is a Pokémon explorer app. The requirements for each challenge are outlined in the corresponding markdown file.

- [Blog App](./BlogApp.md)
- [Pokémon Explorer App](./PokemonExplorerApp.md)

## Evaluation Criteria

The following aspects will be considered when evaluating your submission:

- Functionality: Does the app work as expected?
- Code quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and following best practices?
- Error handling: Does the app handle errors gracefully?
- Proper use of React and TypeScript.

## Submission

- Submit the project as a GitHub repository.
- Include a README file with setup instructions and implementation notes.
- Invite `VladimirLi` and `mferno` as collaborators to the repository.

Best of luck, and we look forward to seeing your solution!
